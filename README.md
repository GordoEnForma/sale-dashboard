- State management via [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/overview)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) for design and styles
- [Recharts.js](https://recharts.org/en-US/) to display data using a set of graphics like tables or pies.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
```
2. Start the frontend application locally
```bash
yarn dev
```
## Auth Credentials

It is not neccesary to have an account for this app.<br/>
But if you want to interact with the forms and the table's actions  
You need to type <b>```admin```</b> both for Username and Password inputs. <br/>
